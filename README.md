## Setup
To run this project, clone the project:

```
$ git clone
$ cd cricket
```

Generate a new secret key:

```
$ python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
```

If running the local dev server paste the new secret key into the cricket/cricket/settings.py file 

```python
SECRET_KEY = [New Key]
```

To keep the secret key private use dotenv package by creating a .env file in the project root that containes SECRET_KEY = [New Key] and leaving the settings.py unchanged.

Install python version 3.8 and required libraries into a virtual environment:

```
$ sudo python3.8
$ pip install venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the django development server:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
